# ðŸš§ 1.21 Status: In development ðŸš§
This project is currently in the development phase. We have begun development. Check back soon for updates!

This project is not a feature port like EaglyMC!
# NOTE:-
***The project only mimic's Minecraft like behaviour, it is not MineCraft but is Eaglercraft. It doesn't use MineCraft's source, maybe? IDk, mate. It cant be taken down because it doesn't violate the EULA, but we never agreed to it. Regards, The Developers, EaglerDevs***
